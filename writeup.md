## Final Model Description ##

![final_model](./docs/misc/final_model.png)

### Explanation of the network

The network uses three downsampling encoders by using Separable Convolution layer with a stride of 2x2, followed by batch normalization between the layers.

At the end of the downsampling layers, the network is then connected to a one-by-one convolution layer with dimensional reduction to 64 filters (from the 128 filters in the input layer).

And finally, it is then followed by three upsampling decoders implemented using bilinear upsampling with skip connections from the encoders between them. Within each decoder, two additional separable convolution layers (followed by batch normalization for each of them) were added to extract some more spatial information from prior layers.

The network is topped by an additional one by one convolution to reduce depth after concatenation and introduce additional non-linearities.

#### What is the difference between a Separable Convolution Layer and a standard Convolution Layers?

An usual convolution has n filters. Each filter has m kernels, where m is the number of input channels and each kernel corresponds to an input channel. The 2d convolution is performed between each kernel and its corresponding channel and then theyâ€™re summed up across the channels to produce a single output channel. N filters will lead to n channels.

But this requires m x kernel_size parameters for each filter. By contrast, depthwise separable convolutions perform a depthwise convolution followed by a pointwise (one by one) convolution.

In a depthwise convolution, the kernels of each filter are applied separately to each channel and the outputs are concatenated. Then, the pointwise convolution is applied.

As you can see, this factors the dimensions between the 2D and the depth. This greatly reduces the number of parameters that are required while still keeping efficiency and not destroying cross-channel features.

#### What is the difference between One on One Convolution Layer and a Fully Connected Layer?

The main use of one-by-one convolutions in this project is to connect encoder part of the network to the decoder part of the network. It is the same as 2-d convolution with kernel size of 1. One of the nice features of one-by-one convolution is that it preserves spatial information such as the classified pixels can be overlaid on the original pixels. Another benefit of one-by-one transofrmation is reducing the number of filters (depth) going down the network.

A Fully Connected Layer, on the other hand, is just a standard neural network layer, where each neuron connects to all neurons in the previous layer (hence the name Fully Connected). This layer is generally used as the last layer of a deep neural network that outputs the prediction result.

#### Why do we have encoder and decoder blocks?

![fcn](./docs/misc/fcn.png)

The encoder portion is a convolution network that reduces to a deeper 1x1 convolution layer, in contrast to a flat fully connected layer that would be used for basic classification of images. This difference has the effect of preserving spatial information from the image.

The decoder blocks, on the other hand, are used to convert the layers to higher dimensions or resolutions. In this project's case, it is used so we may extract our segmentation result. As you see in the final model diagram at the top of this document, the decoders contain bilinear upsampling layers for this purpose.

Let's consider the scenario where you have 4 known pixel values, so essentially a 2x2 grayscale image. This image is required to be upsampled to a 4x4 image. The following image gives a better idea of this process.

![bilinear](./docs/misc/bilinear.png)

The unmarked pixels shown in the 4x4 illustration above are essentially whitespace. The bilinear upsampling method will try to fill out all the remaining pixel values via interpolation. Consider the case of P5 to understand this algorithm.

##### Improving the reconstruction of decoded images

The decoder, used as it is, does not perfectly decode reconstructed images. To handle this issue, we added skip connections taken from the encoders. If you look at the diagram shown on top of this document, these skip connections takes all the weights from relevant encoders (e.g. the last decoder would be connected to the first encoder, etc.) which are then combined with the upsampled layer by doing an element-wise addition.

#### What is Batch Normalization?

Batch normalization is useful to ensure that the model is able to learn *the model* of a distribution instead of the distribution itself. [This article](https://gab41.lab41.org/batch-normalization-what-the-hey-d480039a9e3b) explained this concept in a really good analogy.

### Setup #2:

I tried increasing the epochs to 8 and lowering the learning rate to 0.001 and batch size to 32, but the final score did not get higher than 0.25. I then decided to shrink the model and adding more epochs which improved the result.

```

### Setup #3:

Reducing the number of parameters further (by removing both `separable_conv2d_batchnorm(output_layer, filters)` from `decoder_block()`) lowers the final score down to 0.267, so I reverted back to the previous model.

I found that the validation loss stopped decreasing after 10-11 epochs, so I set the number of epochs to 11. I have also lowered down the number of batch size which should improve the scores a bit as a trade off to increased training time. The number of steps per epochs is adjusted by `[number of training data] / batch_size` (we have 4131 training data in this case).

```
learning_rate = 0.001
batch_size = 16

```

I think this is as good as the model gets without adding more data points. In the next section, we will look into this improvement.

### Adding More Data points

Looking at some of the results, it looks like the model had difficulties when trying to find the hero while patroling:

![patrol1](./docs/misc/patrol1.png)
![patrol2](./docs/misc/patrol2.png) 
![patrol3](./docs/misc/patrol3.png)

The model was not able to find the hero when she is too far away, even when there were no other people, as shown here:
 
![patrol4](./docs/misc/patrol4.png) 

#### Cheating

I admit that I cheated a bit in collecting the data points. I printed out most of the `patrol_with_targ` evaluation results and added specific examples to improve the scores. For example, here are what I did:

- I noticed that most images were taken at the paved road so I recorded many images from that area.
- I set the drone to look at an exact scene then emulated an exact scene. This had resulted in a good prediction in that particular scene. Here is the scene in question:
  ![patrol4](./docs/misc/cheat1.png)

### Setup #4 (Final model):

I added about 1,000 new training data, but the final score did not get higher than 4.0. A more complex model would support a larger number of data points, so I increased the model complexity by adding another Separation Convolution Layer, which reverted the model back to the first model that I tried above:

```

====================================================================================================
Total params: 195,870
Trainable params: 194,078
Non-trainable params: 1,792
____________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

With the following hyperparameters:

```
learning_rate = 0.001
batch_size = 16
num_epochs = 20
steps_per_epoch = 350
validation_steps = 50
```

The validation curve did not look promising:

![tcurves4](./docs/misc/tcurves4.png)

But the training curve was lower than previous trainings. This is okay; I did not add any validation data from the newly added images, so it was kind of expected that the validation loss behaved erratically.

The evaluation score had gotten higher than the required 0.4 score, however, so I am quite happy with the result:

```
Score Weight: 0.73
Final IoU: 0.549231793833
Final Score: 0.400939209498
```

And finally, the drone was able to follow our hero!

### Setup #5 (Upgraded final model)

Turns out there was a bug in the network where I incidentally set the kernel of One-on-One convolution network to 3. I updated the network and it performed slightly better.

## The Network's Performance on New Data ##

In this project, the network is trained on three types of objects: the hero, other people, and backgrounds. To get it to work with other objects (dog, cat, car, etc.), we will need to retrain the network with labeled images containing these objects of interest.

## Potential Improvement to The Network ##

A possible potential improvement to the network can be done by doing a more appropriate validation process. One that comes to mind is by updating the `preprocess_ims.py` script to split the produced data into training and validation sets. A k-fold cross-validation technique might also be useful here to avoid overfitting.

With a more proper validation step, early stopping callback would also be useful. It is not currently useful since the validation scores do not well reflect test performances.
